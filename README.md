Project 1 P1 - Rainfall Flood Simulation (Point Cloud Data)

I compile by doing: 
1. make 
2. ./stat < testdata.txt

If you want to compile your own test data then:
1. clone this project directory or copy the source files
2. make
3. /stat < "yourfile".txt 

My program reads point cloud data in a x,y, height format. It then calculates and displays the minimum height and its coordinates, the maximum height and its coordinates and the average height of all the point cloud data

I compile and test using MSYS2 MINGW64
